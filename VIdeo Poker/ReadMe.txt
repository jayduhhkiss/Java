1st - I found no use for the Player class. I tried very hard to add methods to it and call from it, 
	  but then it would not let my program compile. It seemed to make more sense to do with out. 
		
2nd - I used a lot of brute force methods, and I took the long way to solve many of my problems. 
      For example the Collection.sort ...I simply could not get the hang of it. I had to resort back 
      to Selection sort. 
      
3rd - I also struggled building a hand to test my evaluations. So I instead played a lot of games of 
	  poker.
